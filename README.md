This repository is created for the **Scientific Programming** module to document my progress and work on various practical exercises. I implemented programs that focus on core programming concepts and numerical methods throughout the semester.

## ALL PRACTICAL SUMMARIES

1. **Practical 2:**  
   I Worked on floating-point arithmetic to observe precision issues and implemented harmonic series summation in ascending and descending orders.

2. **Practical 3:**  
   Calculated the area under \( f(x) = \tan(x) \) using the trapezoidal rule with 12 equidistant points.

3. **Practical 4:**  
   Computed \( \tan(x) \) values for angles between 0 and 60 degrees and integrated them using the trapezoidal rule.

4. **Practical 5:**  
   Implemented the Fibonacci series using pointers and approximated the hyperbolic tangent using Maclaurin series and 
logarithms.

5. **Practical 6:**  
   Performed matrix multiplication (\( A_{5 \times 3} \times B_{3 \times 4} \)) using modular code with a Makefile for compilation.

6. **Practical 7:**  
   Dynamically allocated arrays to estimate \( e \) using polynomials and performed operations like filling and printing arrays with pointers.

7. **Practical 8:**  
   Solved for the GCD of two integers using both iterative and recursive implementations of the Euclidean algorithm.

8. **Practical 9:**  
   I Verified if a given matrix is a magic square by checking row, column, and diagonal sums with file-based input handling.

## COMPILATION and EXECUTION

- For individual practicals:
1. Navigate to the folder containing the source files.
2. Compile using GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc <source_files> -o <output_file> [-lm if needed for combing math operations]

- Execution
  ```bash
  ./<output_file>

  For practical 6:
  make
  ./matmult_program
  make clean
